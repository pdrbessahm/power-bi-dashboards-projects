# 📊 Power BI Dashboards Projects

Welcome! This repository is dedicated to documenting my **Power BI learning journey** from early study projects to full end-to-end business dashboards. Here, I build, test, and refine visual solutions that combine **data storytelling**, **DAX modeling**, and **dashboard design** to develop real-world analytical skills.

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:
- Practice Power BI fundamentals and advanced features.
- Explore data modeling, DAX calculations, and visualization techniques.
- Build a **portfolio** that reflects my progress and growth as a data professional.

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each project is stored in its own folder and typically includes:
- `.pbix` file – the Power BI dashboard.
- `csv` or `xlsx` files – the dataset used.
- `README.md` – short project documentation (objective, insights, measures, and visuals).

Example:
Superstore-Dashboard/
├── SuperstoreDashboard.pbix
├── /csv-files
├── /xlsx-files
└── README.md

## 🚀 Next Steps

As I continue to study Power BI, new projects will be added covering:
- KPI tracking dashboards  
- Sales & marketing analytics  
- Financial performance reports  
- Data automation and refresh pipelines  

Follow along as this repository evolves into a complete **Power BI portfolio**.
